# hls-proxy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/passy/hls-proxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/passy/hls-proxy)

> A tool that if you're lucky you'll never need.

A collection of various unportable hacks to transform HLS streams for debugging
purposes. This is highly tailored towards the sort of setup I'm working with right now, so it will almost certainly not work out-of-the-box for you.

## Setup (mitmproxy)

`mitmproxy` is great! Getting TLS to run your device is actually surprisingly
easy. I'll assume here that you're setting up an Android device.

- Install [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/). They've got packages for pretty
  much everything.
- Set your device's HTTP proxy to your local machine's IP address, port 8888.
- Run `mitmproxy` bare-bones in the same WiFi as your device: `mitmproxy -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8888`.
- Go to [mitm.it](http://mitm.it) and install the TLS CA certificate.
- I haven't changed the `mitm_redirect.py` script to take parameters, so you may
  need to update it to match your host settings.
- Run `mitmproxy` again, this time in script mode to redirect all requests to
  the target host to `hls_proxy` instead: `mitmproxy -s mitm_redirect.py -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8888`.

## Setup (Charles)

Charles is way more painful to setup, but to each their own. I'll assume here that you're setting up an Android device.

- Get [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) set up on your machine.
- Make sure your on the same WiFi as your phone.
- Install and trust the Charles TLS certificate. The recommended way of installing it through http://charlesproxy.com/getssl didn't work. I had to download it on a laptop, adb-push it to the device and manually install it there. YMMV.
- Enable SSL proxying in Charles (I think it's the default, but better double-check).
- Build this tool (see below) and start it on, let's say port 8080: `hls-proxy -- -p 8080 my-cdn.com`
- Set up a remote port mapping in Charles, by going to `Tools -> Map Remote` and set up a rule proxying to your local reverse proxy, e.g. "From: https://my-cdn.com:443/ -> http://localhost:8080"

Now use your app, device or whatever and start a stream. You should see the access log on stdout. If not, something went wrong with your Charles setup. Back to StackOverflow, sorry.

## Building

This tool is built with [stack](http://haskellstack.org).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/passy/hls-proxy
cd hls-proxy
stack setup
stack build
stack exec hls-proxy -- --help
```
